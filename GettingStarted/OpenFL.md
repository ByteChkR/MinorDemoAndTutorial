# OpenFL
The ExampleCode is Provided in the [OpenFL_Begin Solution](../Tutorial/OpenFL_Begin/Program.cs)
OpenFL is an Interpreter Language that comes with the engine, it is aimed at reducing the effort required to generate textures and to create sequences of CL Kernel executions.

## Setting up the Interpreter in C#
The interpreter operates on a script and an input buffer.
First we need to create an input buffer almost exactly like in the [IntoOpenCL](IntoOpenCL.md) Example.
```csharp
	int texWidth = 128; //Width of the input texture
    int texHeight = 128; //Height of the input texture
    MemoryBuffer buffer = //Creating the Input Buffer
        Clapi.CreateEmpty<byte>(
            Clapi.MainThread, //We use the Main thread instance
            texWidth * texHeight * 4, //The image size in bytes
            MemoryFlag.ReadWrite); //We want to read and write to the texture
```
Then we can already start to initialize the Interpreter
Note: The Constructor is parsing the Script and is Processing the Define Statements, so this can take some time depending on the script
```csharp
	Interpreter i = new Interpreter( //Creating an interpreter instance
        Clapi.MainThread, //We use the main thread
        "assets/filter/red.fl", //The file to execute
        DataTypes.Uchar1, //The Data type of our input buffer
        buffer, //The buffer
        texWidth, //Width
        texHeight, //Height
        1, //Depth, for images always 1
        4, //Channel count(BGRA)
        "assets/kernel/", //Directory for all kernels
        true); //the "brk" statement is ignored.
```
So now we can start processing the script we supplied.
The Script:
```yaml
Main: #Every FL script that will be executed needs a Main function that is serving as entry point.
    setactive 2 #Activate channel 2 (BG[R]A)
    setv 1 #Set the channel value to 1
```
We do this by making a do while loop like so.
```csharp
	do
	{
    	i.Step(); //Step through the Instructions one by one until the script terminated.
    } while (!i.Terminated);

```
After the Script terminated, the Result buffer(The buffer that is left as active by the script) can be returned by calling interpreter.GetResult<T>().
Alternatively any buffer can be returned by calling interpreter.GetBuffer(string) providing the name as an argument.
Doing this will result in the buffer not beeing disposed when the interpreter is disposing.
```csharp
	byte[] buf = i.GetResult<byte>(); //Returning the Result buffer as Bytes
	Texture tex = TextureLoader.BytesToTexture(buf, texWidth, texHeight); //Making a texture.
```
