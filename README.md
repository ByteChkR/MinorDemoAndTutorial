# Minor Engine Demo and Tutorial Repository
This Repository Contains Code Examples and Small Writeups to all Major [Engine](https://github.com/ByteChkR/Minor) Functions

You Can follow the guide below to set up the examples on your machine or you can take a look in the [Getting Started Section](./GettingStarted/GettingStarted.md).
## Setting Up the Code:
* Clone the repository with `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ByteChkR/MinorDemoAndTutorial`.
* Once the Repository has been Downloaded, you need to build the submodules in the `Minor` directory, this has to be done once when downloaded and will not be needed after initial setup. This can be done by navigating to the `Minor` Folder and starting `build_submodules.bat`.

The Setup for Building and Starting the Projects with Visual Studio is now Completed.

To also Build the Projects with the BuildTools and Test them out in the player, you can start `Tutorial/build_all.bat`. This requires the BuildTools Installed on the machine.
